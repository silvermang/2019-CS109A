    "# Higgs Boson Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of the Higgs boson in July 2012 marked a fundamental breakthrough in particle physics. The Higgs boson particle was discovered through experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, by colliding beams of protons at high energy. A key challenge in analyzing the results of these experiments is to differentiate between collisions that produce Higgs bosons and collisions that produce only background noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with data from Monte-Carlo simulations of collisions of particles in a particle collider experiment. The training set is available in `Higgs_train.csv` and the test set is in `Higgs_test.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a particle collision described by 28 features (columns 1-28), of which the first 21 features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator, and the remaining features are derived by physicists from the first 21 features. The class label is provided in the last column, with a label of 1 indicating that the collision produces Higgs bosons (signal), and a label of 0 indicating that the collision produces other particles (background).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set provided to you is a small subset of the HIGGS data set in the UCI machine learning repository. The following paper contains further details about the data set and the predictors used: [Baldi et al., Nature Communications 5, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5308)."
